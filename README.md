# EGRESS
## 1st Place Best In-Theme out of 90 teams at [SwampHacks IX](https://2023.swamphacks.com/)
### [Submission to Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/egress)

## Inspiration
Inspiration for EGRESS came from old MS-DOS text-based adventure games.
## What it does
EGRESS is a text-based RPG made entirely in batch script that runs fully in command prompt. Explore an unknown forest and experience multiple endings in this replayable role playing game.
## How we built it
We built EGRESS through batch script, a very limited high level program made for running commands on cmd prompt.
## Challenges we ran into
Batch is a very limited program. The game essentially had to be made in a singular "main" script that jumped from countless one-use functions. Batch also doesn't allow you adjust variables within the bounds of a conditional, and has three types of variables - numericals, strings, and inputs. Programming in batch was very different from any language any of us had ever learned.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Learning a new coding language that none of our group members were familiar with was quite the feat. I am now confident in my ability to code rudimentary to medium scale programs in batch script.
## What we learned
Teamwork, patience, and Batch.
## What's next for EGRESS
We plan to expand upon EGRESS's base gameplay by adding new features such as more items, new potential enemies, and alternate endings.
